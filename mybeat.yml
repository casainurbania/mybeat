################### Mybeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Mybeat ######################################

mybeat:
  # Defines how often an event is sent to the output
  period: 5s
  dataid: 0

#================================ Outputs =====================================
# Configure outputs to gseagent
output.console:
# linux agent default ipc file config
# windows agent socket config
#endpoint: "/usr/local/gse/gseagent/ipc.state.report"
#endpoint: "127.0.0.1:47000"

# try times and interval when disconnect to agent
retrytimes: 3
retryinterval: 3s

# send timeout
#writetimeout: 5s

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, filebeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/filebeat

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  #name: filebeat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  #keepfiles: 7
